## Brief summary of the project:

In this project, the objective is to analyze and extract valuable insights from a dataset containing information about academic papers and their citation relationships. Two graphs are constructed to model these relationships: a citation graph, representing unweighted and directed paper citations, and a collaboration graph, representing weighted and undirected collaborations among authors. Due to the dataset's size, the analysis focuses on the most connected component of the graphs, specifically the top 10,000 papers with the highest number of citations. The project is divided into Backend and Frontend components, with specific functionalities to examine graph features, identify influential papers/authors, find the shortest ordered walk in the collaboration graph, disconnect graphs, and extract communities.

Furthermore, the following questions have been awnsered in CommandLine.sh file.

1-Is there any node that acts as an important "connector" between the different parts of the graph?

2-How does the degree of citation vary among the graph nodes?

3-What is the average length of the shortest path among nodes?

And Finally, in the algorithm question we awnsered the maximum global score that can be achieved with the available athletes.
